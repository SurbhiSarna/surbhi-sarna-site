              <strong>What is Pranic Healing?</strong>
              <br />
              <br />
              This Life Energy is also called as Prana Shakti. We are surrounded
              by an ocean of cosmic life-giving energy. This is the basis of the
              science of healing. Our physical body has a corresponding
              electromagnetic field also called as aura or energy body. The
              physical and energy bodies are interconnected.
              <br />
              <br />
              The energy body contains energy centers called chakras which are
              responsible for many physical and psychological functions. Our
              energy body is constantly absorbing this life-giving prana and
              expelling used up prana. Disease occurs when there are blockages
              in this flow of energy. Pranic healing is a non-touch healing
              therapy which works on the energy body. Any physical, mental, or
              emotional problems arise due to improper flow of prana in the
              energy centers (chakras).
              <br />
              <br />
              Pranic healing is a wonderful tool to balance energies and
              accelerate the clientâ€™s healing process. Thoughts and feelings
              also have energy and accumulation of negative thoughts and
              emotions affects the functioning of the chakras which manifests as
              disease or psychological problems.
