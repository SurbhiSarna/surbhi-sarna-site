    "Disease is generally considered a result of external material causes. Few people realize that it comes through the inaction of the Life Force within. Medicine, massage, and electricity merely help to stimulate the cells in such a way that the Life Energy is induced to return and resume its work of maintenance and repair. All methods of healing are really indirect ways of rousing the life energy, which is the true and direct healer of all diseases.";

              <strong>What is Pranic Healing?</strong>
              <br />
              <br />
              This Life Energy is also called as Prana Shakti. We are surrounded
              by an ocean of cosmic life-giving energy. This is the basis of the
              science of healing. Our physical body has a corresponding
              electromagnetic field also called as aura or energy body. The
              physical and energy bodies are interconnected.
              <br />
              <br />
              The energy body contains energy centers called chakras which are
              responsible for many physical and psychological functions. Our
              energy body is constantly absorbing this life-giving prana and
              expelling used up prana. Disease occurs when there are blockages
              in this flow of energy. Pranic healing is a non-touch healing
              therapy which works on the energy body. Any physical, mental, or
              emotional problems arise due to improper flow of prana in the
              energy centers (chakras).
              <br />
              <br />
              Pranic healing is a wonderful tool to balance energies and
              accelerate the clientâ€™s healing process. Thoughts and feelings
              also have energy and accumulation of negative thoughts and
              emotions affects the functioning of the chakras which manifests as
              disease or psychological problems.
