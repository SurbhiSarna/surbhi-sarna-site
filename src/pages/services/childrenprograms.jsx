              The demands and pressures that children face today are
              unparalleled. There are rising cases of depression, violence,
              bullying, suicide and anxiety in children as young as five. It is
              imperative that we also focus on the mental, emotional and
              spiritual needs of children.
              <br />
              <br />
              I offer several programs and workshops for children focused
              on social emotional skills such as building confidence,
              understanding and managing emotions, being mindful, connecting
              with nature, practicing kindness and gratitude and building better
              habits. I use storytelling extensively in each program.
